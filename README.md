Some more usage information is available in the [FAQ](https://wakatime.com/faq).

## Configuring

Options can be passed via command line, or set in the `$WAKATIME_HOME/.wakatime.cfg` config file. Command line arguments take precedence over config file settings. The `$WAKATIME_HOME/.wakatime.cfg` file is in [INI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) format. See [Configuring](CONFIGURING.md) for more details.
